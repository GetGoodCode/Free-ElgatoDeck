# Free-ElgatoDeck
The deal behind this repo is to provide users with a script to behave the same way an Elgato streaming deck can without actually purchasing one. This will be constantly modified and altered to suite music demands, UI customization including actual buttons and eventually issuing command/programs, etc.
